# portfolio
This is my portfolio of programs and projects that I want to share. 

I am currently studying computer engineering at UiT Narvik, but this repository will be my public repository separated from school work.

So I really enjoy programming and these programs and projects will be my own projects that I want to do to learn and get better at coding.

I hope you find some or maybe even all of them interesting.
I also hope that if you are a programmer like me and are learning that maybe some of my codes may be helpful for you!

To end my note I want to share one(or rather 5) of my favourite words which has helped me write much better programs:
The 5S pillars:

Seiri     (Sort)
Seiton    (Set in Order)
Seiso     (Shine)
Seiketsu  (Standardize)
Shitsuke  (Sustain)

The 5S Pillars provide a methodology for organizing, cleaning, developing, and sustaining a productive work environment. 
I found the 5S Pillars from Robert C. Martin's book "Clean Code" and I have lived by them since I read it
and I highly recommend reading the book if you are interested in writing better and cleaner codes!
