# portfolio
This is my portfolio of programs and projects that I want to share. 

I am currently studying computer engineering at UiT Narvik, but this repository will be my public repository separated from school work.

So I really enjoy programming and these programs and projects will be my own projects that I want to do to learn and get better at coding.

I hope you find some or maybe even all of them interesting.
I also hope that if you are a programmer like me and are learning that maybe some of my codes may be helpful for you!
